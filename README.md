# Designsystem for KS Digital

The KS Digital Designsystem builds upon [Designsystemet from Digdir](https://www.designsystemet.no/).

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

Our goal is to align closely with the components and design decisions of Designsystemet while maintaining a set of custom components that address the unique requirements of our projects. This approach ensures consistency with established standards while allowing flexibility for customization.

_Work in Progress_

## ðŸš€ Release and Publishing

### Prerequisites

You need publish access to perform the following steps.

1. Run the following command from a machine with access to publish on NPM:

```bash
nx release --skip-publish
```

This will:

- Create a local Git tag for the release.
- Generate changelogs based on conventional commits.
- Perform a semantic version bump. Note: This command will not push the package to NPM.

2. Push to the remote repository, including the new version tag:

```bash
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

3. The [publish pipeline](.github/workflows/publish.yml) will automatically detect the new release and publish the packages to the NPM registry.
